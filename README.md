# BlideHS

## Smart contracts

- We use the Solidity[^1] language to write smart contracts.

- *BlideHS_PB.sol*: For PB within the PnF organization, we use Ganache[^2] to test smart contract functionality within PnF.

- *BlideHS_CB.sol*: For BlideHS's CB, we use the open-source FISCO BCOS[^3] for deployment testing.

- BlideHS protects smart contracts from attacks through the use of the SafeMath function library[^4], input format checking, and invocation permission checking. The designed smart contract passed the vulnerability analysis of the open source tool Oyente[^5].
